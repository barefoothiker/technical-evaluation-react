# Clown Portal

## Summary

Add and delete clowns, allowing entry of some personal details.
LocalStorage is used for data persistence.
I used the ng5-slider plugin to allow clowns to set the craziness level. This makes for a richer user interface and the features provided by this plugin are not there in framework I am using.
As a starter, I used this free template. (https://demos.creative-tim.com/material-dashboard-angular2/#/dashboard).
